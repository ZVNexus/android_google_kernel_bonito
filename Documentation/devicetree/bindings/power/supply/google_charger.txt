google_charger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required properties:
 - compatible : "google,charger"
 - google,chg-power-supply: name of the charge control power supply
 - google,bat-power-supply: name of the Fuel Gauge power supply
 - google,chg-update-interval: delay in ms to wait before re-running the work
     item
 - google,chg-battery-capacity: the nominal capacity used to compute the
     effective 1C charge rate
 - google,chg-temp-limits: the temperature buckets limits defining the indexes
     of the constant charge limits (row index in google,chg-cc-limits)
 - google,chg-cv-limits: steps voltage limits (column index in
     google,chg-cc-limits)
 - google,chg-cc-limits: the array of constant current charge rates given in %
     of google,chg-battery-capacity

Optional properties:
 - google,wlc-power-supply: name of wireless charing input power supply
 - google,cv-hw-resolution: the constant voltage setting resolution in micro
     volt defaults to 25000
 - google,cc-hw-resolution: the constant current setting resolution in micro amp
     defaults to 25000
 - google,cv-range-accuracy: the voltage margin in micro volt to consider a
     given CV step has been reached. Defaults to 15000.
 - google,cv-range-accuracy-cnt: the number of update-interval delay the battery
     voltage needs to consecutively be within the google,cv-range-accuracy
     accuracy to coinsider CV step to be reached.
 - google,chg-tolerance: the deci-percent tolerance we need to give the PMIC to
     ensure actual current is below chg-cc-limits (divide by 10 to get
     percentage points). Max allowed tolerance is 25%.
